This piece will be focusing on Sidhu and his misadventures as a daaku, which cause moral complications for him because, ultimately, he is not bad at heart (noting his ad lib: ‘Dil da nee maara!’, which appears in intros). The daaku character is highly interesting to analyse because their reasons for being gangsters is rarely because they want to cause malice for its own sake; there&#39;s usually more to this type of person and what led to them becoming a gangster, and often you’ll find that they have a space in their heart for God. The contradictions that come from this make the daaku a multi-dimensional character worthy of observation.‍ </p><p> Being one of the biggest faces of the Punjabi hip hop sub-genre, it’s easy to see the influences Sidhu has acquired from rappers belonging to its parent genre: American hip hop, where the blueprint of the gangster life was laid down through articulate and catchy lyrics that still reverberate in popular culture to this day. There are many parallels of themes, ideas, and styles across the two styles of music – the most prevalent of which is the difficult choice a hustler must make between God and gun.   ‍ </p><p> Sidhu Moose Wala’s discography naturally carries traces of the thug life gene, and we’ve picked out several powerful lyrics where both artists have voiced mutual ideas about the trappings of sin, despite having a place for God in their hearts.‍ </p><p> This piece is divided into two sections. The first section is mainly concerned with Sidhu&#39;s fictional daaku persona, whereas the second section (taken from the transcript of the video version of this story) finds out how the real life Sidhu compares to the character he plays in his songs.‍ </p></div><h2 class="post-h2">Story</h2><div class="post-para-block"><p> On ‘47’, Sidhu revels in his infamy and the feats of bravery required to earn that reputation, spitting triumphant lines that seek to impress a girl (‘muttiyare’) that he’s presumably infatuated with: </p><p class="lyrics-og"> 6 foot da jussa ni, rehnda barrel mooreh taneya. </p><p class="lyrics-trans"> My 6-foot body stands bravely in front of the barrel. </p><p> Violence has long been an undercurrent of Sidhu’s music, as he has stylistically mirrored the thug life aesthetic fashioned by influential gangster rappers like Tupac Shakur, Biggie Smalls, and Snoop Dogg; even the Sidhu logo is a remix of the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas video game art as a tribute to hip hop culture. </p><p> In hip hop, the stories told by lyricists are often mired in a moral struggle between virtue and sin (Coolio’s ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’ and Tupac’s ‘Only God Can Judge Me’ come to mind in particular), and Sidhu’s music certainly stays true to form, where the dichotomy of God and gun is a recurring theme throughout his entire body of work. We’ve been previously accustomed to one-dimensional daakus in Punjabi films, whose motivations are monochromatically evil, but what this mix of Punjabi and hip hop does is create self-aware daakus, who now have their own medium to confess and reflect on their lifestyle. </p><p>   The blueprint for Sidhu’s daaku persona can be partly traced back to All Eyez on Me, a pivotal record where Tupac documents the trappings of the thug life. The subject matter covered in this album is bipolar, oscillating between feelings of pride and damnation. In ‘Gangsta Party’ (otherwise known as ‘2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted’), Tupac boasts of his fearlessness to pull the trigger, regardless of his religion: </p><p class="lyrics-og"> ‘I&#39;m losin&#39; my religion, <br> I&#39;m vicious on these stool pigeons’. </p><p> Then, a couple of songs later we reach ‘Only God Can Judge Me’, where that pride is replaced with shame as Tupac turns to God in his hours of need: </p><p class="lyrics-og"> Oh my Lord, tell me what I&#39;m livin&#39; for, <br> Everybody&#39;s droppin&#39; got me knockin&#39; on heaven&#39;s door. </p><p> Similarly, Sidhu boasts about how his enemies fear him, recognising him as the AK47 personified, but also – like Tupac – realises how powerless he is to the grips of vice, which not even prayer can save him from: </p><p class="lyrics-og"> Jeone toh maarne tayi, ni mein kamm jaanda saare, <br> Meinu vairi kehnde ne, ‘47 ni muttiyare, […] <br> Din jaap toh shuru hunda, <br> Aa keh paap teh mittiye mukkda. <br></p><p class="lyrics-og"> ‘From living to dying, I know of all the bad deeds, <br> My enemies call me ‘47, girl. […] <br> The day is ushered with prayer,<br> But ends at sin’s door’. </p><p> What makes the daaku character so interesting in gangster music is that the subject matter tends to be rich in variety – at least in the upper echelons of poetry — as skilled poets word a whole spectrum of conflicting emotions that brew in the day-to-day hustling of a thug. Within the same breath, they’ll go from cursing their enemies, to expressing love. In ‘47’, Sidhu does this with his repeated use of the sweetened nouns ‘mithiye’ and ‘muttiyare’ [young woman], which are used to fill the syllable quota in each line; these nouns are placed within lines where Sidhu is talking about his enemies or his evil deeds.   </p><p> This dichotomy between God and gun is also central to the stylistic choices behind the music video, which mirrors the content of the song by drawing out physical shapes of objects that represent violence and materialism, colouring them with a menacing red against an otherwise abyss of black.     </p><p> I picked out two frames in particular from the video: one of Sidhu, whose blackened outline clenches the AK47 amidst red smoke; and the other of him praying in front of the hanging Persian carpets. The first scene perfectly encapsulates dichotomy of God and gun, because donning the pagri is an acknowledgement of the Lord’s presence, but it’s the AK47 that has control of the both the video frame and our protagonist Sidhu: the poster child for the brotherhood of daakus.   </p></div>',6);function f(e,t,o,f,m,g){var y=Object(a["x"])("MobNav"),v=Object(a["x"])("MoreMusic"),j=Object(a["x"])("Footer");return Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])(a["a"],null,[Object(a["h"])(y),Object(a["h"])("div",s,[Object(a["h"])("div",i,[Object(a["h"])("img",{src:this.post.img,alt:"",class:"post-img"},null,8,["src"])]),Object(a["h"])("div",r,[Object(a["h"])("div",n,[this.post.postH1?(Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])("h1",c,Object(a["z"])(this.post.postH1),1)):Object(a["e"])("",!0),Object(a["h"])("h2",h,Object(a["z"])(this.post.postH2),1),Object(a["h"])("p",l,Object(a["z"])(e.postIntro),1),(Object(a["q"])(!0),Object(a["d"])(a["a"],null,Object(a["w"])(g.lyrics,(function(e,t){return Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])("div",{key:e},[t%2===0?(Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])("p",p,Object(a["z"])(e),1)):(Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])("p",u,Object(a["z"])(e),1))])})),128)),Object(a["h"])("p",d,Object(a["z"])(e.postContent),1),b])])]),Object(a["h"])(v),Object(a["h"])(j)],64)}o("d81d"),o("0481");var m=o("5b80"),g={id:"post-wrapper"},y={class:"post-img-container"},v={class:"post-content-container"},j={id:"tte"},O={key:0,class:"post-h1"},w={class:"post-h2"},k={class:"post-intro"},S={key:0,class:"lyrics-og"},T={key:1,class:"lyrics-trans"},M={class:"post-content"};function G(e,t,o,s,i,r){return Object(a["q"])(!0),Object(a["d"])(a["a"],null,Object(a["w"])(i.post,(function(e){return Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])("div",{key:e},[Object(a["h"])("div",g,[Object(a["h"])("div",y,[Object(a["h"])("img",{src:o.img,alt:"",class:"post-img"},null,8,["src"])]),Object(a["h"])("div",v,[Object(a["h"])("div",j,[o.postH1?(Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])("h1",O,Object(a["z"])(o.postH1),1)):Object(a["e"])("",!0),Object(a["h"])("h2",w,Object(a["z"])(o.postH2),1),Object(a["h"])("p",k,Object(a["z"])(o.postIntro),1),(Object(a["q"])(!0),Object(a["d"])(a["a"],null,Object(a["w"])(o.lyrics,(function(e,t){return Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])("div",{key:e},[t%2===0?(Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])("p",S,Object(a["z"])(e),1)):(Object(a["q"])(),Object(a["d"])("p",T,Object(a["z"])(e),1))])})),128)),Object(a["h"])("p",M,Object(a["z"])(o.postContent),1)])])])])})),128)}var q={data:function(){return{post:[{img:o("cedb"),postH1:"sample",postH2:"sample",postIntro:"",lyricsOG:["sample","sample"],lyricsTrans:["sample","sample"],postContent:""}]}},props:{img:String,postH1:String,postH2:String,postIntro:String,lyricsOG:Array,lyricsTrans:Array,postContent:String,lyrics:Array}};q.render=G;var P=q,z=o("8db1"),A=o("fd2d"),I=(o("78a7"),{name:"app",components:{MobNav:m["default"],Single:P,MoreMusic:z["a"],Footer:A["a"]},data:function(){return{post:{img:o("b43e"),postH1:"Sidhu Moose Wala: '47', The Choice of God or Gun",postH2:"The Punchline Cut",postIntro:"",lyricsOG:[],lyricsTrans:[],lyricsSnippet:[],postContent:""}}},computed:{lyrics:function(){var e=this,t=this.post.lyricsOG.map((function(t,o){return[t,e.post.lyricsTrans[o]]}));return t.flat(1)}}});I.render=f;var x=I,C=o("a18c"),H=o("4360");"serviceWorker"in navigator&&window.addEventListener("load",(function(){navigator.serviceWorker.register("/sw.js")})),Object(a["c"])(x).use(H["a"]).use(C["a"]).mount("#app")},5:function(e,t,o){e.exports=o("1cc1")},cedb:function(e,t,o){e.exports=o.p+"img/amantejhundal.ba7ed4fb.jpg"}});
