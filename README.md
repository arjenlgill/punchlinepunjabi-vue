Understanding how to circumvent the inherent technical SEO issues caused by JavaScript DOM-injection when building sites with frameworks such as Vue and React.

While such frameworks have obvious advantages when it comes to templating, binding functions to HTML elements, and build optimisations such as code-splitting, the JavaScript-first method of building webpages also poses a great threat to technical SEO. In this project I will be learning to use Vue (since such frameworks are here to stay) in a technical SEO-friendly way.
